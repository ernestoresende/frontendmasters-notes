# FrontEnd Masters Notes

This is a series of documents intended at documenting both annotations and coding exercises promoted by FrontEnd Master's classes that I've chosen to enroll. 

Each directory represents a different class classified by their name and author. 

This is solely intended to be used as a reference and complementary learning material.

### Table of Contents:
